# My App Inventor Projects
Here are the apps that I made (for practice purposes only) with blocks programming in **App Inventor** platform.

## Initial Calculator
It is a simple calculator, where it will always have only two operands and one operator. But not so simple, it works to perform at least most of the mathematical operations of a common user's daily life. <br/>
